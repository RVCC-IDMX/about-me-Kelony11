<!-- Site Description -->

# Site Description 
The purpose of this website is to showcase a little bit of my Web Development and Designing skills, as well as my academic status and professionalism. In summary, this websites serves as a online portfolio/forum to just sharing a bit of who i am and what i aspire to be in the future.

<!-- Sections of the Webpage -->

# Header 
This section contains the logo and responsive navbar compatible with desktop and mobile devices. In the process of making this section, i learned about making your website unique and authentic. I had to make sure that Everything included in the header section was original, from the images to the texts. The Hamburger menu Navbar list contains on-click shortcuts to the "Key" (Important) sections of the webpage. Finally, i attached a link to the logo image that refreshes the webpage once it's clicked. 

# Hero 
This sections contains a headshot photo of me, and three bullet points - My Name, Base location and a sentence that highlights me. I learned to build a professional header that would put me in a good light and be presentable to employers.

# Bio 
This section outlines a brief biography of me, highlighting who i am, my academic acheivements and what i plan to be in the future. I learned to present myself in the best way possible.

# Hobbies 
This section outlines my hobbies. I learned arranged my hobbies in order from the most favorite to the least favorite. 

# Projects 
This section outlines three main coding projects i would love to show an employer, although i'm working on showing off better projects in the future. It contains the logo describing the projects, links and name description of the projects. I learned to classify my projects from the most interesting (on the far-left) to the least interesting (on the far-right). 
 
# Resume 
This section contains my resume and a date it's last update. I learned that including my resume in my website and also adding it to the list on the Hamburger menu would attract any visitor opening my webpage for the first time to click on it and view it.

# Gallery 
This section contains the pictures i would love to showoff to whoever views my page. It is displayed in this format - Image, Figcaption ( A short description of the picture ) and a little note of the venue if necessary. I learned to use flex to diplay the contents of this section in a centered and responsive manner. 

# Video 
This scetion contains a youtube video posted on my channel and description of it, followed with the venue. I learned how to embed a video by copying the iframe url so, that users can play the video directly from my website without having to go my YouTube channel.

# Blog 
This section contains vital information on a topic i researched on. It also includes some photos to visually expalian to the users on variable fonts. I learned how to add a drop cap in the paragrapg to target a certain letter within a child. I also learned to express my ideas to be visually appealing to the users by styling the headings and text.

# Contact 
This section contains a simple form to send me a message. I learned to create a contact form that collect people's information and ask them if they want a message reply or not. I had to check with my netlify account to see if the form was working as it should. This was really fun as it gave me some room for creativity and i had to make sure that it was visually appealing. 

# Socials 
This section contains some extra content such as links and logos of my social media accounts. I noticed that life does not starts in ends in the classroom, so i decided add in some of my social media handles incase someone wants to connect with me.  

# back-to-top 
This section contains a clickable icon to simply head back to the top of the Webpage without scrolling. As my website became longer and longer, scrolling back to the top of the page annoyed me a little bit, so i devised a way to get back to the top of the webpage with one click.

# Footer 
This section contains my name and i learned how to add a copyright symbol and a hyperlink to the footer of the webpage, as well as styling it.
